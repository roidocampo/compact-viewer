Project Discontinued
====================

I used this pdf viewer for 2 years, and I was generally happy with it. Except
for one problem: it cannot view DjVu files. Now I use an alternative based on
[Evince][0].

Compact Viewer
==============

A simple PDF viewer for Mac. One window, lots of files.

Download: [version 1.0][1]

Why?
----

When reading PDF files in my computer, I prefer a single-window interface
with an easy way of switching between the opened files. I used
[Clearview][] for a while, which has a tabbed interface, but was never
quite happy with it. So I decided to create a new viewer. It was also a
excuse to learn how to program for the Mac platform.
